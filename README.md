# Air Quality Analysis 2024

## Objective
This project analyzes **global air quality trends** in 2024. The goal is to identify pollution patterns, understand seasonal variations, and highlight which countries or regions have the best and worst air quality. Insights derived from the data help us understand the environmental impact of human activities and climate change.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project comes from [**open air quality data sources**](https://datahub.io/core/air-quality), providing air quality measurements like PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and other pollutants across different regions worldwide.

## Tools Used
- **Python** (for data manipulation and analysis)
  - **pandas**: Data processing and cleaning.
  - **matplotlib** & **seaborn**: Data visualization.
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and visualization.
  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive environment for data analysis and visualizations.

## Installation Instructions
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rasyidbejay/air-quality-analysis-2024.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd air-quality-analysis-2024
   ```

3. **Install the necessary Python libraries**:
   If you donâ€™t have the libraries installed, you can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

   jupyter notebook air_quality_analysis_2024.ipynb
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

## Project Overview

### **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- Load the dataset using **pandas**.
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing certain features to ensure accuracy in analysis.

### **Data Analysis and Visualizations**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating patterns and trends in air quality across different countries and regions.
- **Seasonal Analysis**: Understanding how air quality changes with seasons (winter vs. summer).
- **Pollution Analysis**: Identifying which pollutants are most prevalent in different regions.

### **Key Insights**
- Countries like [Country X] have some of the best air quality, while [Country Y] consistently shows high levels of pollutants.
- Air quality tends to worsen in winter, likely due to increased heating and energy consumption.
- The most common pollutants in [Region] are **PM2.5** and **NO2**, which pose significant health risks.

## Visualizations
This repository includes various visualizations, such as:
- **Air Quality by Country**: A comparison of average pollutant levels across countries.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Graphs showing how air quality fluctuates between seasons.
- **Pollutant Correlation**: Scatter plots demonstrating correlations between different pollutants.
